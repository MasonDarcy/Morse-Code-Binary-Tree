# Morse_Code_Binary_Tree
This is a simple graphical representation of a Morse code "tree", essentially a dichotomic search algorithm. 
The user chooses two distinct alternatives by pressing the F key, inputting either a dit (".") or a dah ("-") in order to 
navigate the tree and finally select a character.
